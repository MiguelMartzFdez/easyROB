### ⚠️ Antivirus / SmartScreen
Since the app is **not code-signed**, it is **normal** that Windows Defender, SmartScreen or other AV software show a warning.  
- Please select **“Run anyway” / “Allow”** if prompted.  
- What matters is whether the file actually runs or if the antivirus blocks/quarantines it.  
- If you encounter issues, report your OS, AV product/version and the exact message.
